# AIMS-Resources

 AIMS Version 0.1

AIMS Version 0.1 has been built using python, Flask, and JavaScript. It includes a python server script which receives the extension requests. After processing the requested images it sends back the textual description of the image. This process may take few seconds to complete.

AIMS Version 0.2

AIMS Version 0.2 has been built using JavaScript. Both AIMS.Builder and AIMS Browser has been fully implemented using JavaScript. This eliminates the need to send requests to the server and improved the performance of the overall process.
